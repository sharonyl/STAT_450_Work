* what are you doing in stats: taking a minor! 
* what are some of your interests: 
    + academic/career interests 
          + strategy consulting
          + data science things
          + differential privacy math 
          + artificial intelligence-adjacent topics
    + just for fun
          + neuroscience/psychopharamcology/psychoneuropharamcology
          + some physics sometimes 
          + analog cameras/film photography

## Learning Goals 

This class is actually extremely similar to a pro-bono consulting group at UBC I participated and then subsequently ran for a few years. The structures were comparable: 

* teams of 5 students
    + 3 typically undergraduate students
    + 2 senior consultants (2nd timers) or MBA students 
* real clients 
* 2+ industry consultant mentors assigned to each team 
* roughly scoped projects that ran for ~3 months 
* 3 official client meetings/project check points 
* final client presentations and showcase w/powerpoints and reports 


The main difference between the pro-bono group (SCI) and this course would be the degree of technical material. SCI was not restricted to projects reliant on a dataset, but rather included projects like: 
 
* new market/product entry/development
* operations optimization 
* customer retention/churn analysis 
* strategy identification/new project evaluation
* KPI development and implementation 

My SCI project consisted of assisting a mutlinational organic retail grocer with measuring and evaluating their green initiatives, specifically their goal to achieve 'zero waste'. We gathered primary data from 4 store locations, as well as research and best practices from comparable companies and industries. Our final recommendation was to renegotiate waste hauler contracts and to benchmark results with samples of manual instore waste audits. 

Overall, I learned a lot from SCI about working with interdisciplinary teams, speaking with upper-level management and client contacts in a professional but persuasive manner, and taking hypothesis baesd approaches to solving ambigious questions. 

Where this course might add additional value beyond SCI would be in areas like: 

* identifying appropriate statistical techniques for a given problem 
* finding the balance between 'business' and 'technical' jargon 
* reviewing and solidying my understanding of statistical techniques
    + knowing underlying assumptions 
    + understanding differences in how certain R functions/pre-built tests differ
    + improving on my technical writing skills and code documentation
